Overview of |TVB|
=================

|TVB| is a framework for the simulation of the dynamics of large-scale brain
networks with biologically realistic connectivity. |TVB| uses tractographic data
(DTI/DSI) to generate connectivity matrices and build cortical and subcortical
brain networks. The connectivity matrix defines the connection strengths and
time delays via signal transmission between all network nodes. Various neural
mass models are available in the repertoire of |TVB| and define the dynamics of
a network node.  Together, the neural mass models at the network nodes and the
connectivity matrix define *The Virtual Brain*. |TVB| simulates and generates
the time courses of various forms of neural activity including Local Field
Potentials (LFP) and firing rate, as well as brain imaging data such as
EEG, MEG and BOLD activations as observed in fMRI.


|TVB| is foremost a scientific simulation platform and provides all means
necessary to generate, manipulate and visualize connectivity and network
dynamics. In addition, |TVB| comprises a set of classical time series analysis
tools, structural and functional connectivity analysis tools, as well as
parameter exploration facilities by launching parallel simulations on a cluster.
